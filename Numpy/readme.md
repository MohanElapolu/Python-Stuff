# Numpy
In here we explore the potential of numpy applied to linear algebra. We will explore all the properties related to vectors and matrices. But we will stay focussed on exploring the abilities of numpy applied to linear algebra. I will think that you have some basic understanding of numpy. This series of notebooks will help you to organize your understanding on the abilities of numpy. 
## Topics:
### Array Creation
### Vector Operations
### Dot Product
### Cross Product
### Matrix creation
### Matrix Opertaions
### Vectorization
### Broadcasting

**Note:** I will mostly follow the documentation of numpy. If you have any doubts or need further explanation refer to https://numpy.org/.
